# Overview

The AMOCcommunity brings together researchers and developers working on sustained observations and analysis of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

We support shared tools, documentation, and coordination across international programs. This documentation provides background, usage guides, and development standards for our collaborative repositories.

Topics include:
- Observing system documentation
- Code and data repositories
- Contribution guidelines
- Data access and formats

## Repositories

The AMOCcommunity GitHub organization maintains and collaborates on a number of open-source repositories for working with observational and modeled AMOC data.

### üîß Internal Repositories

- [`amocarray`](https://github.com/AMOCcommunity/amocarray)  
  Standardized access to AMOC mooring array data (MOVE, RAPID, OSNAP, SAMBA).

- [`amoc-docs`](https://github.com/AMOCcommunity/amoc-docs)  
  This documentation repository.

### üåê External Tools and Collaborations

- [`metric`](https://github.com/NCAR/metric)  
  Evaluation and diagnostics for model-observation comparison, including AMOC metrics.

- [`RapidMoc`](https://github.com/cdr30/RapidMoc)  
  Tools for working with RAPID array data, including streamfunction estimates and data formatting.

- [`OSNAP`](https://www.o-snap.org/for-modelers/) (planned link)  
  Code for OSNAP model truth.
